# [3016. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-pushes-to-type-word-ii/)

You are given a string `word` containing lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with **distinct** collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key `2` is mapped with `["a","b","c"]`, we need to push the key one time to type `"a"`, two times to type `"b"`, and three times to type `"c"` .

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered `2` to `9` to **distinct** collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to **any** amount of letters, but each letter **must** be mapped to **exactly** one key. You need to find the **minimum** number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string `word`.

Return _the **minimum** number of pushes needed to type `word` after remapping the keys_.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that `1`, `*`, `#`, and `0` do **not** map to any letters.

### Example 1:
   ![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/12/26/keypadv1e1.png)
 - **Input**: `word = "abcde"`
 - **Output**: `5`
 - **Explanation**: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
 - `"a"` -> one push on key `2`
 - `"b"` -> one push on key `3`
 - `"c"` -> one push on key `4`
 - `"d"` -> one push on key `5`
 - `"e"` -> one push on key `6`
 - Total cost is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
 - It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

### Example 2:
   ![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/12/26/keypadv2e2.png)
 - **Input**: `word = "xyzxyzxyzxyz"`
 - **Output**: `12`
 - **Explanation**: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
 - `"x"` -> one push on key `2`
 - `"y"` -> one push on key `3`
 - `"z"` -> one push on key `4`
 - Total cost is `1 * 4 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12`.
 - It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
 - Note that the key `9` is not mapped to any letter: it is not necessary to map letters to every key, but to map all the letters.

### Example 3:
   ![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/12/27/keypadv2.png)
 - **Input**: `word = "aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii"`
 - **Output**: `24`
 - **Explanation**: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
 - `"a"` -> one push on key `2`
 - `"b"` -> one push on key `3`
 - `"c"` -> one push on key `4`
 - `"d"` -> one push on key `5`
 - `"e"` -> one push on key `6`
 - `"f"` -> one push on key `7`
 - `"g"` -> one push on key `8`
 - `"h"` -> two pushes on key `9`
 - `"i"` -> one push on key `9`
 - Total cost is `1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 24`.
 - It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= word.length <= 1e5`
 - `word` consists of lowercase English letters.

---
### Hints:
 - We have 8 keys in total. We can type 8 characters with one push each, 8 different characters with two pushes each, and so on.
 - The optimal way is to map letters to keys evenly.
 - Sort the letters by frequencies in the word in non-increasing order.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - The most frequent characters should require the fewest button presses.
 - Build a frequency map.
 - Sort its values.
 - Assign all single presses first, then second presses, etc., in decreasing frequency.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n + m.sort)` where `m` is the number of unique characters in `word`
 - Space: `O(m.sort)`

```js
var minimumPushes = function(word) {
    let freq = new Uint32Array(26)
    for (let c of word)
        freq[c.charCodeAt() - 97]++
    return freq.sort((a,b) => b - a)
               .reduce((a,c,i) => a + c * (1 + ~~(i / 8)), 0)
};
```
