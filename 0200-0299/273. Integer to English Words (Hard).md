# [273. Integer to English Words (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/)

Convert a non-negative integer `num` to its English words representation.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `num = 123`
 - **Output**: `"One Hundred Twenty Three"`

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `num = 12345`
 - **Output**: `"Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"`

### Example 3:
 - **Input**: `num = 1234567`
 - **Output**: `"One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"`

---
### Constraints:
 - `0 <= num <= 2^31 - 1`

---
### Hints:
 - Did you see a pattern in dividing the number into chunk of words? For example, `123` and `123000`.
 - Group the number by thousands (3 digits). You can write a helper function that takes a number less than `1000` and convert just that chunk to words.
 - There are many edge cases. What are some good test cases? Does your code work with input such as `0`? Or `1000010`? (middle chunk is zero and should not be printed out)

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Unique numbers are anything under 20, all tens numbers, then the suffixes `"Hundred"`, `"Thousand"`, `"Million"`, and `"Billion"`.
 - Deal with each group of three digits together with the appropriate suffix.
 - Remember the `"Zero"` special case.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(n)`

```js
const ones = ["","One","Two","Three","Four","Five","Six",
              "Seven","Eight","Nine","Ten","Eleven",
              "Twelve","Thirteen","Fourteen","Fifteen",
              "Sixteen","Seventeen","Eighteen","Nineteen"],
      tens = [,,"Twenty","Thirty","Forty","Fifty",
              "Sixty","Seventy","Eighty","Ninety"]
var numberToWords = function(num) {
    let res = []
    for (let i = 0; num; i++) {
        res.push(i === 3 ? "Billion" 
               : i === 2 && num % 1000 ? "Million"
               : i === 1 && num % 1000 ? "Thousand"
               : "")
        if (num % 100 < 20)
            res.push(ones[num % 100]), num = ~~(num / 100)
        else {
            res.push(ones[num % 10]), num = ~~(num / 10)
            res.push(tens[num % 10]), num = ~~(num / 10)
        }
        if (num % 10)
            res.push("Hundred", ones[num % 10])
        num = ~~(num / 10)
    }
    return res.filter(Boolean).reverse().join(" ") || "Zero"
};
```
