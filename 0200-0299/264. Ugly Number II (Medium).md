# [264. Ugly Number II (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/)

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return _the `n`th **ugly number**_.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `n = 10`
 - **Output**: `12`
 - **Explanation**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12]` is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `n = 1`
 - **Output**: `1`
 - **Explanation**: `1` has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= n <= 1690`

### Hints:
 - The naive approach is to call `isUgly` for every number until you reach the `n`th one. Most numbers are not ugly. Try to focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones.
 - An ugly number must be multiplied by either `2`, `3`, or `5` from a smaller ugly number.
 - The key is how to maintain the order of the ugly numbers. Try a similar approach of merging from three sorted lists: `L1`, `L2`, and `L3`.
 - Assume you have `Uk`, the `k`th ugly number. Then `Uk+1` must be `Min(L1 * 2, L2 * 3, L3 * 5)`.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Each new number must be made by multiplying a `2`, `3`, or `5` with a previous number.
 - Keep separate track of which numbers have been used with which multipliers.
 - Add the smallest next number.
 - Skip any repeated numbers.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var nthUglyNumber = function(n) {
    let res = [1], a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, val
    while (res.length < n) {
        let x = res[a] * 2, y = res[b] * 3, z = res[c] * 5
        res.push(val = Math.min(x, y, z))
        a += val === x, b += val === y, c += val === z
    }
    return res.at(-1)
};
```
