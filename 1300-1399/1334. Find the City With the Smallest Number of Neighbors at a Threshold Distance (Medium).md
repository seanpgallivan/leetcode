# [1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/)

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from, to, weight]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `from` and `to`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is **at most** `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities `i` and `j` is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

### Example 1:
![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_01.png)
 - **Input**: `n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4`
 - **Output**: `3`
 - **Explanation**: The neighboring cities at a `distanceThreshold = 4` for each city are:
   - City 0 -> [City 1, City 2]
   - City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3]
   - City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3]
   - City 3 -> [City 1, City 2]
   - Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a `distanceThreshold = 4`, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.

### Example 2:
![diagram 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_02.png)
 - **Input**: `n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2`
 - **Output**: `0`
 - **Explanation**: The neighboring cities at a `distanceThreshold = 2` for each city are:
   - City 0 -> [City 1] 
   - City 1 -> [City 0, City 4] 
   - City 2 -> [City 3, City 4] 
   - City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
   - City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3] 
   - The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a `distanceThreshold = 2`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `2 <= n <= 100`
 - `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
 - `edges[i].length == 3`
 - `0 <= from < to < n`
 - `1 <= weight, distanceThreshold <= 1e4`
 - All pairs `(from, to)` are distinct.

---
### Hints:
 - Use Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to compute any-point to any-point distances. (Or can also do Dijkstra from every node due to the weights are non-negative).
 - For each city calculate the number of reachable cities within the threshold, then search for the optimal city.

---
## Solution
### Notes:
 - Use **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** to efficiently find the shortest distance between each pair of cities.
 - Check each city to see which one matches the criteria for the answer.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n^3)`
 - Space: `O(n^2)`

```js
var findTheCity = function(n, edges, distanceThreshold) {
    let dist = Array.from({length: n}, () => new Uint32Array(n).fill(-1))
    for (let [a,b,w] of edges)                                              // Set initial edge info
        a < b ? dist[a][b] = w : dist[b][a] = w
    for (let k = 0; k < n; k++)                                             // Floyd-Warshall
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)
            for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
                dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j],
                                      (i < k ? dist[i][k] : dist[k][i])
                                      + (j < k ? dist[j][k] : dist[k][j]))
    let ans, bestCount = 1e9
    for (let i = n - 1; ~i; i--) {                                          // Count cities matching
        let count = 0                                                       //   criteria
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++)
            count += dist[j][i] <= distanceThreshold
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
            count += dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold
        if (count < bestCount)                                              // Update ans
            ans = i, bestCount = count
    }
    return ans
};
```
