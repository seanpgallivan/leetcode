# [592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-addition-and-subtraction/)

Given a string `expression` representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, return the calculation result in string format.

The final result should be an [**irreducible fraction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_fraction). If your final result is an integer, change it to the format of a fraction that has a denominator `1`. So in this case, `2` should be converted to `2/1`.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `expression = "-1/2+1/2"`
 - **Output**: `"0/1"`

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `expression = "-1/2+1/2+1/3"`
 - **Output**: `"1/3"`

### Example 3:
 - **Input**: `expression = "1/3-1/2"`
 - **Output**: `"-1/6"`

---
### Constraints:
 - The input string only contains `'0'` to `'9'`, `'/'`, `'+'` and `'-'`. So does the output.
 - Each fraction (input and output) has the format `Â±numerator/denominator`. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then `'+'` will be omitted.
 - The input only contains valid **irreducible fractions**, where the **numerator** and **denominator** of each fraction will always be in the range `[1, 10]`. If the denominator is `1`, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.
 - The number of given fractions will be in the range `[1, 10]`.
 - The numerator and denominator of the **final result** are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of **32-bit** int.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Since the numbers are all `<= 10`:
   - If the second digit is a `0`, the number is `10`, otherwise, it's just the single digit.
   - We don't need to bother with calculating the **least common multiplier**, we can just calculate the **greatest common denominator** afterward.
 - Keep track of the sign separately and pretend that every subtraction is really an addition with a negative.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n log n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
const gcd = (a, b) => b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a

var fractionAddition = function(exp) {
    let n = exp.length, numer = 0, denom = 1
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let sign = exp[i] < 10 || exp[i++] === '+' ? 1 : -1,
            newNumer = exp[i + 1] === '0' ? (i++, 10) : ~~exp[i],
            newDenom = exp[(i += 2) + 1] === '0' ? (i++, 10) : ~~exp[i]
        numer = numer * newDenom + sign * newNumer * denom
        let gcdVal = gcd(Math.abs(numer), denom * newDenom)
        numer /= gcdVal, denom *= newDenom / gcdVal
    }
    return `${numer}/${denom}`
};
```
