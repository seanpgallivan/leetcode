# [589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

Given the `root` of an n-ary tree, return _the preorder traversal of its nodes' values_.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)

**Follow up**: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

### Example 1:
![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)
 - **Input**: `root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]`
 - **Output**: `[1,3,5,6,2,4]`

### Example 2:
![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)
 - **Input**: `root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`
 - **Output**: `[1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10]`

---
### Constraints:
 - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
 - `0 <= Node.val <= 1e4`
 - The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - The standard approach is a recursive function processing the root, then children from left to right.
 - For an iterative approach we can use a stack.
 - We'll need to iterate through each array of children in reverse.

### Javascript (recursive):
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(m)` where `m` is the maximum depth of the tree

```js
var preorder = function(root, res=[]) {
    if (root) {
        res.push(root.val)
        root.children.forEach(child => preorder(child, res))
    }
    return res
};
```

### Javascript (iterative):
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(m)` where `m` is the maximum depth of the tree

```js
var preorder = function(root) {
    let res = [], stack = [root], curr
    while (curr = stack.pop()) {
        res.push(curr.val)
        curr.children.reduceRight((_,c) => stack.push(c), 0)
    }
    return res
};
```
