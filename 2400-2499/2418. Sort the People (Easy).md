# [2418. Sort the People (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/)

You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of **distinct** positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `i`th person.

Return _`names` sorted in **descending** order by the people's heights_.

---
### Example 1:
 - Input: `names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]`
 - Output: `["Mary","Emma","John"]`
 - Explanation: `Mary` is the tallest, followed by `Emma` and `John`.

### Example 2:
 - Input: names = `["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]`
 - Output: `["Bob","Alice","Bob"]`
 - Explanation: The first `Bob` is the tallest, followed by `Alice` and the second `Bob`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `n == names.length == heights.length`
 - `1 <= n <= 1e3`
 - `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
 - `1 <= heights[i] <= 1e5`
 - `names[i]` consists of lower and upper case English letters.
 - All the values of `heights` are distinct.

---
### Hints:
 - Find the tallest person and swap with the first person, then find the second tallest person and swap with the second person, etc. Repeat until you fix all `n` people.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Create an index lookup array.
 - Sort it based on `height`.
 - Map it to the corresponding `names`.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n.sort)`
 - Space: `O(n)`

```js
var sortPeople = (names, heights) => 
    _.range(names.length)
     .sort((a,b) => heights[b] - heights[a])
     .map(el => names[el])
```
