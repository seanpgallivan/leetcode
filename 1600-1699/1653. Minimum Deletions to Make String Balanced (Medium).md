# [1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-balanced/)

You are given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'` and `'b'`​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in `s` to make `s` **balanced**. `s` is **balanced** if there is no pair of indices `(i,j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] = 'b'` and `s[j] = 'a'`.

Return _the **minimum** number of deletions needed to make `s` **balanced**_.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `s = "aababbab"`
 - **Output**: `2`
 - **Explanation**: You can either:
   - Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions `2` and `6` (`"aababbab" -> "aaabbb"`), or
   - Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions `3` and `6` (`"aababbab" -> "aabbbb"`).

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `s = "bbaaaaabb"`
 - **Output**: `2`
 - **Explanation**: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= s.length <= 1e5`
 - `s[i]` is `'a'` or `'b'`​​.

---
### Hints:
 - You need to find for every index the number of `b`'s before it and the number of `a`'s after it
 - You can speed up the finding of `a`'s and `b`'s in suffix and prefix using preprocessing

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - To satisfy the conditions, all `a`'s must be before all `b`'s.
 - The answer will involve deleting some (or none) `b`'s from the left and some (or none) `a`'s from the right.
 - If we know the total number of `a`'s, we can iterate through and calculate the number of deletions for each possible midpoint.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var minimumDeletions = function(s) {
    let n = s.length, ans = 0, a = 0, {min} = Math
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)
        ans += s[i] === "a"
    for (let i = 0, total = ans; ans && i < n; i++)
        ans = min(ans, i + 1 + total - 2 * (a += s[i] === "a"))
    return ans
};
```
