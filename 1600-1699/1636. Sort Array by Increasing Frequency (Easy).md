# [1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-increasing-frequency/)

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in **increasing** order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in **decreasing** order.

Return _the sorted array_.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]`
 - **Output**: `[3,1,1,2,2,2]`
 - **Explanation**: `'3'` has a frequency of `1`, `'1'` has a frequency of `2`, and `'2'` has a frequency of `3`.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `nums = [2,3,1,3,2]`
 - **Output**: `[1,3,3,2,2]`
 - **Explanation**: `'2'` and `'3'` both have a frequency of `2`, so they are sorted in decreasing order.

### Example 3:
 - **Input**: `nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]`
 - **Output**: `[5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]`

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
 - `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---
### Hints:
 - Count the frequency of each value.
 - Use a custom comparator to compare values by their frequency. If two values have the same frequency, compare their values.

---
## Solution
### Notes:
 - Build a frequency map of numbers.
 - Refill `nums` based on the indicated sort order.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n.sort)`
 - Space: `O(n.sort)`

```js
var frequencySort = function(nums) {
    let freq = new Map(), i = 0
    for (let x of nums)
        freq.set(x, ~~freq.get(x) + 1)
    let nsort = [...freq.entries()]
    nsort.sort((a,b) => a[1] - b[1] || b[0] - a[0])
    for (let [k,v] of nsort)
        while (v--)
            nums[i++] = k
    return nums
};
```
