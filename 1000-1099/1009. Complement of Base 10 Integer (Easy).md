# [1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/)

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.
 - For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `n`, return _its complement_.

**Note**: This question is the same as [476: Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/).

### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `n = 7`
 - **Output**: `0`
 - **Explanation**: `7` is `"111"` in binary, with complement `"000"` in binary, which is `0` in base-10.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `n = 10`
 - **Output**: `5`
 - **Explanation**: `10` is `"1010"` in binary, with complement `"0101"` in binary, which is `5` in base-10.

### Constraints:
 - `0 <= n < 1e9`
    
---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - The sum of `n` and its complement will have all used bits filled with `1`s.
 - This is equal to one less than the next power of `2`.
 - We can use `log2()` to efficiently find out the relevant power of `2`.
 - Then we can subtract `n` to find its complement.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(log n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
const bitwiseComplement = n => (1 << ~~Math.log2(n)) * 2 - n - 1
```
