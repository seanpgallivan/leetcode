# [1568. Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-disconnect-island/)

You are given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An **island** is a maximal **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`'s.

The grid is said to be **connected** if we have **exactly one island**, otherwise is said **disconnected**.

In one day, we are allowed to change **any** single land cell (`1`) into a water cell (`0`).

Return _the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid_.

### Example 1:
![diagram 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/24/land1.jpg)
 - **Input**: `grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]`
 - **Output**: `2`
 - **Explanation**: We need at least `2` days to get a disconnected grid.
   - Change land `grid[1][1]` and `grid[0][2]` to water and get 2 disconnected island.

### Example 2:
![diagram 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/24/land2.jpg)
 - **Input**: `grid = [[1,1]]`
 - **Output**: `2`
 - **Explanation**: Grid of full water is also disconnected (`[[1,1]]` -> `[[0,0]]`), 0 islands.

---
### Constraints:
 - `m == grid.length`
 - `n == grid[i].length`
 - `1 <= m, n <= 30`
 - `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

---
### Hints:
 - Return `0` if the grid is already disconnected.
 - Return `1` if changing a single land to water disconnect the island.
 - Otherwise return `2`.
 - We can disconnect the grid within at most `2` days.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - There are only three possible answers: '0', '1', or '2'
 - If there is no land at all, or if there are already more than one island, the answer is `0`.
 - If there's an **articulation point**, where removing a single cell will disconnect the island, the answer is `1`.
 - Otherwise, it will only take `2` diagonal removals to isolate any corner land piece.
 - Create a dfs helper to scan for articulation points in an island, keeping track of the total land found.
 - Iterate through `grid` and launch the dfs helper if we find land.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n * m)`
 - Space: `O(n * m)` for the recursion stack

```js
const dirs = [-1,0,1,0,-1]                                      // 4-way movement helper

var minDays = function(grid) {
    let n = grid.length, m = grid[0].length,                    // We use increasing turns to track
        total = 0, ans = 2, {min} = Math                        //   where cycle connects to itself
    
    const dfs = (i, j, from=-3, turn=2) => {
        total++, grid[i][j] *= turn                             // Keep track of total land & use grid
        let preRes = 1e9, postRes = 1e9                         //   to keep track of visited lands
        for (let d = 0; d < 4; d++)                             // Navigate four directions,
            if (d !== (from + 2) % 4) {                         //   but ignore previous land,
                let x = i + dirs[d], y = j + dirs[d + 1]        //   since we're looking for a cycle
                if (~x && ~y && x < n && y < m)
                    if (grid[x][y] === 1)
                        postRes = min(postRes,                  // postRes is result *after* next move
                                      dfs(x, y, d, turn + 1))
                    else if (grid[x][y] > 1)
                        preRes = min(preRes, grid[x][y])        // preRes is result *before* next move
            }
        if ((preRes === 1e9 && postRes == 1e9) ||               // Dead end ("leaf node") land
            (turn > 2 && (postRes < 1e9 && postRes >= turn)))   // Articulation point: more lands, but
            ans = 1                                             //   no path back to before this land
        return min(preRes, postRes)
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (let j = 0; j < m; j++)
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                if (total)
                    return 0                                    // If this is a second island, return 0
                dfs(i, j)                                       // Otherwise, run DFS helper
            }
    
    return total < 3 ? total : ans                              // Deals w/ edge case for tiny/no island
};
