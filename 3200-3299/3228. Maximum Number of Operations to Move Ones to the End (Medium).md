# [3228. Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-to-move-ones-to-the-end/)

You are given a binary string `s`.

You can perform the following operation on the string **any** number of times:
 - Choose **any** index `i` from the string where `i + 1 < s.length` such that `s[i] == '1'` and `s[i + 1] == '0'`.
 - Move the character `s[i]` to the **right** until it reaches the end of the string or another `'1'`. For example, for `s = "010010"`, if we choose `i = 1`, the resulting string will be `s = "000110"`.

Return the **maximum** number of operations that you can perform.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `s = "1001101"`
 - **Output**: `4`
 - **Explanation**: We can perform the following operations:
   - Choose index `i = 0`. The resulting string is `s = "0011101"`.
   - Choose index `i = 4`. The resulting string is `s = "0011011"`.
   - Choose index `i = 3`. The resulting string is `s = "0010111"`.
   - Choose index `i = 2`. The resulting string is `s = "0001111"`.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `s = "00111"`
 - **Output**: `0`

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= s.length <= 1e5`
 - `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

---
### Hints:
 - It is optimal to perform the operation on the lowest index possible each time.
 - Traverse the string from left to right and perform the operation every time it is possible.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - To find the maximum, always move left to right so they get stuck on later ones before they're moved.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var maxOperations = function(s) {
    let ans = 0, curr = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++)
        if (s[i] === '1')
            curr++
        else {
            ans += curr
            while (s[i + 1] === '0')
                i++
        }
    return ans
};
```
