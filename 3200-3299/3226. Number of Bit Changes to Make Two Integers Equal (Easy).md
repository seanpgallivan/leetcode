# [3226. Number of Bit Changes to Make Two Integers Equal (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-bit-changes-to-make-two-integers-equal/)

You are given two positive integers `n` and `k`.

You can choose **any** bit in the **binary representation** of `n` that is equal to `1` and change it to `0`.

Return the _number of changes_ needed to make `n` equal to `k`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

---
### Example 1:
 - Input: `n = 13, k = 4`
 - Output: `2`
 - Explanation: Initially, the binary representations of `n` and `k` are `n = 1101` and `k = 0100`. We can change the first and fourth bits of `n`. The resulting integer is `n = 0100 = k`.

### Example 2:
 - Input: `n = 21, k = 21`
 - Output: `0`
 - Explanation: `n` and `k` are already equal, so no changes are needed.

### Example 3:
 - Input: `n = 14, k = 13`
 - Output: `-1`
 - Explanation: It is not possible to make `n` equal to `k`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= n, k <= 1e6`

---
### Hints:
 - Find the binary representations of `n` and `k`.
 - Any bit that is equal to `1` in `n` and equal to `0` in `k` needs to be changed.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - If `k` has any bits that `n` doesn't, return -1.
 - Otherwise, the answer is the number of bits that `n` has but `k` doesn't.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(log k)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
const minChanges = (n, k) => (k & n) === k ? bitcount(n ^ k) : -1

const bitcount = x => {
    let y = (x | 0) - (x >> 1 & 0x55555555),
        z = (y & 0x33333333) + (y >> 2 & 0x33333333)
    return (z + (z >> 4) & 0x0F0F0F0F) * 0x01010101 >> 24
}
```
