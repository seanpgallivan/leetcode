# [3222. Find the Winning Player in Coin Game (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winning-player-in-coin-game/)

You are given two **positive** integers `x` and `y`, denoting the number of coins with values `75` and `10` _respectively_.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each turn, starting with **Alice**, the player must pick up coins with a **total** value `115`. If the player is unable to do so, they **lose** the game.

Return the _name_ of the player who wins the game if both players play **optimally**.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `x = 2, y = 7`
 - **Output**: `"Alice"`
 - **Explanation**: The game ends in a single turn:
   - Alice picks `1` coin with a value of `75` and `4` coins with a value of `10`.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `x = 4, y = 11`
 - **Output**: `"Bob"`
 - **Explanation**: The game ends in 2 turns:
   - Alice picks `1` coin with a value of `75` and `4` coins with a value of `10`.
   - Bob picks `1` coin with a value of `75` and `4` coins with a value of `10`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= x, y <= 100`
---
### Hints:
 - The only way to make `115` is to use one coin of value `75` and four coins of value `10`. Each turn uses up these many coins.
 - Hence the number of turns is `min(x, y / 4)`.
 - Determine the winner from its parity.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - The only possible combination is `1 x 75 + 4 x 10 = 115`.
 - We can find the minimum number of complete turns using these numbers.
 - Odd results mean Alice wins, even results mean Bob wins.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(1)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var losingPlayer = (x, y) => Math.min(x, ~~(y / 4)) % 2 ? "Alice" : "Bob"
```
