# [3249. Count the Number of Good Nodes (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-good-nodes/)

There is an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [a, b]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a` and `b` in the tree.

A node is **good** if all the subtrees rooted at its children have the same size.

Return the number of **good** nodes in the given tree.

A **subtree** of `treeName` is a tree consisting of a node in `treeName` and all of its descendants.

### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]`
 - **Output**: `7`
 - **Explanation**: All of the nodes of the given tree are good.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,5],[1,6],[2,7],[3,8]]`
 - **Output**: `6`
 - **Explanation**: There are 6 good nodes in the given tree. They are colored in the image below.

### Example 3:
 - **Input**: `edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[0,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,8],[0,9],[9,10],[9,12],[10,11]]`
 - **Output**: `12`
 - **Explanation**: All nodes except node `9` are good.

### Constraints:
 - `2 <= n <= 1e5`
 - `edges.length == n - 1`
 - `edges[i].length == 2`
 - `0 <= a, b < n`
 - The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

---
### Hints:
 - Use DFS.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Build an edgemap.
 - Use recursive DFS helper to count subtree size and report back up.
 - If all children of a node have the same size, increment `ans`.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(n)`

```js
var countGoodNodes = function(edges) {
    let n = edges.length + 1, ans = 0,
        emap = Array.from({length: n}, () => [])
    for (let [a,b] of edges)
        emap[a].push(b), emap[b].push(a)
    const dfs = (node, par) => {
        let count = -1, good = true, sum = 1, res = 0
        for (let next of emap[node])
            if (next !== par) {
                sum += res = dfs(next, node)
                if (~count && res !== count)
                    good = false
                count = res
            }
        ans += good
        return sum
    }
    dfs(0, -1)
    return ans
};
```
