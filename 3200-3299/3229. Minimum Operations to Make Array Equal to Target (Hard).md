# [3229. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal-to-target/submissions/)

You are given two positive integer arrays `nums` and `target`, of the same length.

In a single operation, you can select any subarray of nums and increment or decrement each element within that subarray by `1`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make `nums` equal to the array `target`.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `nums = [3,5,1,2], target = [4,6,2,4]`
 - **Output**: `2`
 - **Explanation**: We will perform the following operations to make `nums` equal to `target`:
   - Increment `nums[0..3]` by `1`, `nums = [4,6,2,3]`.
   - Increment `nums[3..3]` by `1`, `nums = [4,6,2,4]`.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `nums = [1,3,2], target = [2,1,4]`
 - **Output**: `5`
 - **Explanation**: We will perform the following operations to make `nums` equal to `target`:
   - Increment `nums[0..0]` by `1`, `nums = [2,3,2]`.
   - Decrement `nums[1..1]` by `1`, `nums = [2,2,2]`.
   - Decrement `nums[1..1]` by `1`, `nums = [2,1,2]`.
   - Increment `nums[2..2]` by `1`, `nums = [2,1,3]`.
   - Increment `nums[2..2]` by `1`, `nums = [2,1,4]`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= nums.length == target.length <= 1e5`
 - `1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 1e8`

---
### Hints:
 - Change `nums[i] = nums[i] - target[i]`, so our goal is to make `nums` into all `0`s.
 - Divide and conquer.

---
## Solution
### Notes:
 - We can selectively keep applying previous increment segments to each new number.
 - The contribution from earlier iterations is capped by the previous application (`nums[i] - target[i]`) on one end and `0` on the other.
 - We can run an extra iteration to clear the excess `prev` value.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space" `O(1)`

```js
var minimumOperations = function(nums, target) {
    let n = nums.length, ans = prev = 0, {max} = Math
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        ans += max(0, -prev + ~~(prev = nums[i] - target[i]))
    return ans
};
```
```js
const minimumOperations=(n,t,p=0,m=Math.max)=>n.reduce((a,c,i)=>a+m(0,-p+(p=c-t[i])),0)+m(-p,0)
```
