# [3242. Design Neighbor Sum Service (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-neighbor-sum-service/)

You are given a `n x n` 2D array grid containing **distinct** elements in the range `[0, n2 - 1]`.

Implement the `neighborSum` class:
 - `neighborSum(int [][]grid)` initializes the object.
 - `int adjacentSum(int value)` returns the **sum** of elements which are adjacent neighbors of `value`, that is either to the top, left, right, or bottom of `value` in `grid`.
 - `int diagonalSum(int value)` returns the **sum** of elements which are diagonal neighbors of `value`, that is either to the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right of `value` in `grid`.

### Example 1:
![diagram 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/24/designexample0.png)
 - **Input**:
   - `["neighborSum", "adjacentSum", "adjacentSum", "diagonalSum", "diagonalSum"]`
   - `[[[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]], [1], [4], [4], [8]]`
 - **Output**: `[null, 6, 16, 16, 4]`
 - **Explanation**:
   - The adjacent neighbors of `1` are `0`, `2`, and `4`.
   - The adjacent neighbors of `4` are `1`, `3`, `5`, and `7`.
   - The diagonal neighbors of `4` are `0`, `2`, `6`, and `8`.
   - The diagonal neighbor of `8` is `4`.

### Example 2:
![diagram 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/24/designexample0.png)
 - **Input**:
   - `["neighborSum", "adjacentSum", "diagonalSum"]`
   - `[[[[1, 2, 0, 3], [4, 7, 15, 6], [8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 5]]], [15], [9]]`
 - **Output**: `[null, 23, 45]`
 - **Explanation**:
   - The adjacent neighbors of `15` are `0`, `10`, `7`, and `6`.
   - The diagonal neighbors of `9` are `4`, `12`, `14`, and `15`.

### Constraints:
 - `3 <= n == grid.length == grid[0].length <= 10`
 - `0 <= grid[i][j] <= n^2 - 1`
 - All `grid[i][j]` are distinct.
 - `value` in `adjacentSum` and `diagonalSum` will be in the range `[0, n2 - 1]`.
 - At most `2 * n^2` calls will be made to `adjacentSum` and `diagonalSum`.

---
### Hints:
 - Find the cell `(i, j)` in which the element is present.
 - You can store the coordinates for each value.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Pre-process the sums to avoid redoing it on demand (which would also require storing a separate lookup table anyway).

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n^2)`
 - Space: `O(n^2)`

```js
const aDirs = [0,1,0,-1,0], dDirs = [1,-1,-1,1,1]

class neighborSum {
    constructor(grid) {
        let n = grid.length 
        this.aSums = new Uint32Array(n * n)
        this.dSums = new Uint32Array(n * n)
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++)
                for (let d = 0; d < 4; d++) {
                    this.aSums[grid[i][j]] += ~~grid[i + aDirs[d]]?.[j + aDirs[d + 1]]
                    this.dSums[grid[i][j]] += ~~grid[i + dDirs[d]]?.[j + dDirs[d + 1]]
                }
    };
    adjacentSum(value) { return this.aSums[value] };
    diagonalSum(value) { return this.dSums[value] };
};
```
