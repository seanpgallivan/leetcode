# [3238. Find the Number of Winning Players (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-winning-players/)

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of players in a game and a 2D array `pick` where `pick[i] = [x, y]` represents that the player `x` picked a ball of color `y`.

Player `i` **wins** the game if they pick **strictly more** than `i` balls of the **same** color. In other words,
 - Player 0 wins if they pick any ball.
 - Player 1 wins if they pick at least two balls of the same color.
 - ...
 - Player `i` wins if they pick at least `i + 1` balls of the _same_ color.

Return the number of players who **win** the game.

**Note** that _multiple_ players can win the game.

### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `n = 4, pick = [[0,0],[1,0],[1,0],[2,1],[2,1],[2,0]]`
 - **Output**: `2`
 - **Explanation**: Player 0 and player 1 win the game, while players 2 and 3 do not win.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `n = 5, pick = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]`
 - **Output**: `0`
 - **Explanation**: No player wins the game.

### Example 3:
 - **Input**: `n = 5, pick = [[1,1],[2,4],[2,4],[2,4]]`
 - **Output**: `1`
 - **Explanation**: Player 2 wins the game by picking 3 balls with color 4.

---
### Constraints:
 - `2 <= n <= 10`
 - `1 <= pick.length <= 100`
 - `pick[i].length == 2`
 - `0 <= x <= n - 1`
 - `0 <= y <= 10`

---
### Hints:
 - Keep track of the number of balls of each color for each user using hashing.
 - Find the maximum color that occurred for each player.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Iterate through `pick` and track counts for each player's picks in an array of maps.
 - Iterate through each player's pick map and find out if any value is larger than their index.

```js
var winningPlayerCount = function(n, pick) {
    let pmap = Array.from({length: n}, () => new Map())
    for (let [i, p] of pick)
        pmap[i].set(p, ~~pmap[i].get(p) + 1)
    return pmap.reduce((a,c,i) => a + (Math.max(...c.values())> i), 0)
};
```
