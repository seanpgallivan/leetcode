# [3248. Snake in Matrix (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/snake-in-matrix/)

There is a snake in an `n x n` matrix `grid` and can move in **four possible directions**. Each cell in the `grid` is identified by the position: `grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j`.

The snake starts at cell `0` and follows a sequence of commands.

You are given an integer `n` representing the size of the `grid` and an array of strings `commands` where each `command[i]` is either `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`. It's guaranteed that the snake will remain within the `grid` boundaries throughout its movement.

Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing `commands`.

### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `n = 2, commands = ["RIGHT","DOWN"]`
 - **Output**: `3`
 - **Explanation**:

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `n = 3, commands = ["DOWN","RIGHT","UP"]`
 - **Output**: `1`
 - **Explanation**:

---
### Constraints:
 - `2 <= n <= 10`
 - `1 <= commands.length <= 100`
 - `commands` consists only of `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`.
 - The input is generated such the snake will not move outside of the boundaries.

---
### Hints:
 - Try to update the row and column of the snake after each command.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - All moves are cumulative, so we can just add together all the moves
 - Down and up are `-n` and `+n`

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var finalPositionOfSnake = function(n, commands) {
    let ans = 0
    for (let com of commands)
        ans += com === "UP" ? -n
             : com === "DOWN" ? n
             : com === "LEFT" ? -1
             : 1
    return ans
};
```
