# [3240. Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-make-binary-grid-palindromic-ii/)

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`.

A row or column is considered **palindromic** if its values read the same forward and backward.

You can **flip** any number of cells in `grid` from `0` to `1`, or from `1` to `0`.

Return the **minimum** number of cells that need to be flipped to make **all** rows and columns **palindromic**, and the total number of `1`'s in `grid` **divisible** by `4`.

### Constraints:
 - `m == grid.length`
 - `n == grid[i].length`
 - `1 <= m * n <= 2 * 1e5`
 - `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1`

---
### Hints:
 - For each `(x, y)`, find `(m - 1 - x, y)`, `(m - 1 - x, n - 1 - y)`, and `(x, n - 1 - y)`; they should be the same.
 - Note that we need to specially handle the middle row (column) if the number of rows (columns) is odd.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Aside from the potential middle row and/or column, changes made to the rest of the grid will always result in `1`'s in multiples of `4`.
 - For each quartet of cells in those areas, we add up the `ones` and make `min(ones, 4 - ones)` changes.
 - If there are an odd number of rows and/or columns, we need to:
   - Treat middle row/column separately, and for each we must change one of any non-matching pair.
   - If we make any changes to either middle row or column, we can choose to change in a manner that will guarantee a multiple of `4`.
   - If a middle row or column exists, but everything matches, we might still have to make changes if the number of ones is not a multiple of `4`.
 - We always have to change a `1` in a middle cell.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n * m)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var minFlips = function(grid) {
    let n = grid.length - 1, m = grid[0].length - 1,
        ans = 0, ones = 0
    if (n % 2 === 0)
        for (let i = n >> 1, j = m - 1 >> 1; ~j; j--) {
            ones += grid[i][j]
            ans += grid[i][j] !== grid[i][m - j]
        }
    if (m % 2 === 0)
        for (let i = n - 1 >> 1, j = m >> 1; ~i; i--) {
            ones += grid[i][j]
            ans += grid[i][j] !== grid[n - i][j]
        }
    ans ||= (ones % 2) * 2
    for (let i = n - 1 >> 1; ~i; i--)
        for (let j = m - 1 >> 1; ~j; j--) {
            ones = grid[i][j] + grid[i][m - j]
                 + grid[n - i][j] + grid[n - i][m - j]
            ans += Math.min(ones, 4 - ones)
        }
    return ans + ~~grid[n / 2]?.[m / 2]
};
```
