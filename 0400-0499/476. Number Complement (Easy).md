# [476. Number Complement (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.
 - For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `num`, return _its complement_.

**Note**: This question is the same as [1009: Complement of Base 10 Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/).

### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `num = 5`
 - **Output**: `2`
 - **Explanation**: The binary representation of `5` is `101` (no leading zero bits), and its complement is `010`. So you need to output `2`.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `num = 1`
 - **Output**: `0`
 - **Explanation**: The binary representation of `1` is `1` (no leading zero bits), and its complement is `0`. So you need to output `0`.

### Constraints:
 - `1 <= num < 2^31`
    
---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - The sum of `num` and its complement will have all used bits filled with `1`s.
 - This is equal to one less than the next power of `2`.
 - We can use `log2()` to efficiently find out the relevant power of `2`.
 - Then we can subtract `num` to find its complement.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(log n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
const findComplement = num => (1 << ~~Math.log2(num)) * 2 - num - 1
```
