# [624. Maximum Distance in Arrays (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-distance-in-arrays/)

You are given `m` `arrays`, where each array is sorted in **ascending order**.

You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the distance between two integers a and b to be their absolute difference `|a - b|`.

Return _the maximum distance_.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[1,2,3]]`
 - **Output**: `4`
 - **Explanation**: One way to reach the maximum distance `4` is to pick `1` in the first or third array and pick `5` in the second array.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `arrays = [[1],[1]]`
 - **Output**: `0`

---
### Constraints:
 - `m == arrays.length`
 - `2 <= m <= 105`
 - `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 500`
 - `-1e4 <= arrays[i][j] <= 1e4`
 - `arrays[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.
 - There will be at most `1e5` integers in all the arrays.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - The best result will be the difference between the smallest number and the largest number.
 - To prevent using numbers from the same array as we iterate through arrays, before we update the min/max values, compare the previous results with their opposite end from the current array.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var maxDistance = function(arrays) {
    let min = 1e9, max = -1e9, ans = 0
    for (let arr of arrays) {
        ans = Math.max(ans, max - arr[0], arr.at(-1) - min)
        max = Math.max(max, arr.at(-1))
        min = Math.min(min, arr[0])
    }
    return ans
};
```
