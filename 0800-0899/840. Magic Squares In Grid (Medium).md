# [840. Magic Squares In Grid (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/magic-squares-in-grid/)

A `3 x 3` **magic square** is a `3 x 3` grid filled with distinct numbers **from** `1` **to** `9` such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given a `row x col` `grid` of integers, how many `3 x 3` contiguous magic square subgrids are there?

Note: while a magic square can only contain numbers from `1` to `9`, `grid` may contain numbers up to `15`.

### Example 1:
![diagram 1a](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/11/magic_main.jpg)
 - **Input**: `grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]`
 - **Output**: `1`
 - **Explanation**: The following subgrid is a `3 x 3` magic square:

   - while this one is not:

![diagram 1c](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/11/magic_invalid.jpg)
   - In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: grid = `[[8]]`
 - **Output**: `0`

---
### Constraints:
 - `row == grid.length`
 - `col == grid[i].length`
 - `1 <= row, col <= 10`
 - `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15`

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - A naive approach here would be just fine, but...
 - There's really only one magic `3 x 3` square. Mathematically, it can be proven that the center cell has to be `5`, the corners have to be even, and the middle sides have to be odd, which leads to only one pattern for the square that can be rotated or mirrored.
 - If we define the pattern, we can quickly find the starting point and direction of a given square based on two consecutivce values and then check to see if the square matches the pattern.
 - We only need to start this check when we find a `5` as the middle of the potential square.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n * m)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
const path = [1,8,3,4,9,2,7,6], ord = {2:5,4:3,6:7,8:1}, dirs = [0,1,0,-1,0]

var numMagicSquaresInside = function(grid) {
    let n = grid.length, m = grid[0].length, ans = 0
    for (let i = 1; i < n - 1; i++)
        for (let j = 1, p; j < m - 1; j++) 
            if (grid[i][j] === 5 && (p = ord[grid[i - 1][j - 1]])) {
                let x = i - 1, y = j - 1, good = true, 
                    step = grid[i - 1][j] === path[(p + 1) % 8] ? 1 : -1
                for (let dir = 0; good && dir < 4; dir++)
                    for (let times = 0; good && times < 2; times++) {
                        if (grid[x][y] !== path[p])
                            good = false
                        x += dirs[dir], y += dirs[dir + 1]
                        p = (p + 8 + step) % 8
                    }
                ans += good
            }
    return ans
};
```
