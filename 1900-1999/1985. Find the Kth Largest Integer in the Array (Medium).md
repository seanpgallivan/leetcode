# [1985. Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-kth-largest-integer-in-the-array/)

You are given an array of strings `nums` and an integer `k`. Each string in `nums` represents an integer without leading zeros.

Return _the string that represents the `k`th **largest integer** in `nums`_.

**Note**: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if `nums` is `["1","2","2"]`, `"2"` is the first largest integer, `"2"` is the second-largest integer, and `"1"` is the third-largest integer.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `nums = ["3","6","7","10"], k = 4`
 - **Output**: `"3"`
 - **Explanation**:
   - The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are `["3","6","7","10"]`.
   - The 4th largest integer in nums is `"3"`.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `nums = ["2","21","12","1"], k = 3`
 - **Output**: `"2"`
 - **Explanation**:
   - The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are `["1","2","12","21"]`.
   - The 3rd largest integer in nums is `"2"`.

### Example 3:
 - **Input**: `nums = ["0","0"], k = 2`
 - **Output**: `"0"`
 - **Explanation**:
   - The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are `["0","0"]`.
   - The 2nd largest integer in nums is `"0"`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1e4`
 - `1 <= nums[i].length <= 100`
 - `nums[i]` consists of only digits.
 - `nums[i]` will not have any leading zeros.

---
### Hints:
 - If two numbers have different lengths, which one will be larger?
 - The longer number is the larger number.
 - If two numbers have the same length, which one will be larger?
 - Compare the two numbers starting from the most significant digit. Once you have found the first digit that differs, the one with the larger digit is the larger number.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - This calls for a **quickselect** implementation.
 - Since the elements are strings, we need to use a custom **comparator**, especially due to the long numbers.
 - Rather than just using `BigInt`s, we could just use a **greedy** approach to compare the two strings.
 - If one string is longer, it's also larger.
 - Otherwise, compare the numbers left-to-right until they don't match, or else the numbers are equal.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var kthLargestNumber = (nums, k) => kthElement(nums, k)

// Custom comparator
const comp = (a,b) => {
    if (a.length !== b.length)
        return b.length - a.length
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
        if (a[i] !== b[i])
            return b[i] - a[i]
    return 0
}

// QuickSelect implementation
const kthElement = (arr, k, left=0, right=arr.length - 1) => {
    while (true) {
        let a = left, b = left, c = right, 
            pivot = arr[findPivot(arr, left, right, comp)]
        while (b <= c) {
            let result = comp(arr[b], pivot)
            if (result < 0)
                swap(arr, a++, b++)
            else if (result > 0)
                swap(arr, b, c--)
            else
                b++
        }
        if (k <= a)
            right = a
        else if (k > b)
            left = b
        else
            return arr[k - 1]
    }
};

const findPivot = (arr, left, right, comp) => {
    let mid = left + right >> 1
    if (comp(arr[left], arr[right]) > 0)
        swap(arr, left, right)
    if (comp(arr[left], arr[mid]) > 0)
        swap(arr, left, mid)
    if (comp(arr[mid], arr[right]) > 0)
        swap(arr, mid, right)
    return mid
}

const swap = (arr, a, b) => {
    let temp = arr[a]
    arr[a] = arr[b], arr[b] = temp
}
```
