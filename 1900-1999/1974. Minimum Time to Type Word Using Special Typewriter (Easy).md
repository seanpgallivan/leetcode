# [1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-type-word-using-special-typewriter/)

There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters `'a'` to `'z'` arranged in a **circle** with a **pointer**. A character can **only** be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is **initially** pointing to the character `'a'`.

Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:
 - Move the pointer one character **counterclockwise** or **clockwise**.
 - Type the character the pointer is **currently** on.

Given a string `word`, return the **minimum** number of seconds to type out the characters in `word`.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `word = "abc"`
 - **Output**: `5`
 - **Explanation**:  The characters are printed as follows:
   - Type the character `'a'` in 1 second since the pointer is initially on `'a'`.
   - Move the pointer clockwise to `'b'` in 1 second.
   - Type the character `'b'` in 1 second.
   - Move the pointer clockwise to `'c'` in 1 second.
   - Type the character `'c'` in 1 second.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `word = "bza"`
 - **Output**: `7`
 - **Explanation**: The characters are printed as follows:
   - Move the pointer clockwise to `'b'` in 1 second.
   - Type the character `'b'` in 1 second.
   - Move the pointer counterclockwise to `'z'` in 2 seconds.
   - Type the character `'z'` in 1 second.
   - Move the pointer clockwise to `'a'` in 1 second.
   - Type the character `'a'` in 1 second.

### Example 3:
 - **Input**: `word = "zjpc"`
 - **Output**: `34`
 - **Explanation**: The characters are printed as follows:
   - Move the pointer counterclockwise to `'z'` in 1 second.
   - Type the character `'z'` in 1 second.
   - Move the pointer clockwise to `'j'` in 10 seconds.
   - Type the character `'j'` in 1 second.
   - Move the pointer clockwise to `'p'` in 6 seconds.
   - Type the character `'p'` in 1 second.
   - Move the pointer counterclockwise to `'c'` in 13 seconds.
   - Type the character `'c'` in 1 second.

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= word.length <= 100`
 - `word` consists of lowercase English letters.

---
### Hints:
 - There are only two possible directions you can go when you move to the next letter.
 - When moving to the next letter, you will always go in the direction that takes the least amount of time.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Start `ans` at `word.length`, since each letter press takes one time.
 - Use the character code to compare the distance in either direction.
 - Add `26` and use the mod operator to ensure a positive result.
 - Add the min distance to `ans`.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var minTimeToType = function(word) {
    let n = word.length, ans = n, prev = 97
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let curr = word.charCodeAt(i)
        ans += Math.min((curr - prev + 26) % 26, (prev - curr + 26) % 26)
        prev = curr
    }
    return ans
};
```
