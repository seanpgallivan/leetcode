# [1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost/)

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (**0-indexed**). Starting with `0` points, you want to **maximize** the number of points you can get from the matrix.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in **each row**. Picking the cell at coordinates `(r, c)` will **add** `points[r][c]` to your score.

However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows `r` and `r + 1` (where `0 <= r < m - 1`), picking cells at coordinates `(r, c1)` and `(r + 1, c2)` will **subtract** `abs(c1 - c2)` from your score.

Return _the **maximum** number of points you can achieve_.

`abs(x)` is defined as:
 - `x for x >= 0`
 - `-x for x < 0`

### Example 1:
![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/12/screenshot-2021-07-12-at-13-40-26-diagram-drawio-diagrams-net.png)
 - **Input**: `points = [[1,2,3],[1,5,1],[3,1,1]]`
 - **Output**: `9`
 - **Explanation**: The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates `(0, 2)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(2, 0)`.
   - You add `3 + 5 + 3 = 11` to your score.
   - However, you must subtract `abs(2 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 2` from your score.
   - Your final score is `11 - 2 = 9`.

### Example 2:
![diagram 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/12/screenshot-2021-07-12-at-13-42-14-diagram-drawio-diagrams-net.png)
 - **Input**: `points = [[1,5],[2,3],[4,2]]`
 - **Output**: `11`
 - **Explanation**: The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates `(0, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(2, 0)`.
   - You add `5 + 3 + 4 = 12` to your score.
   - However, you must subtract `abs(1 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 1` from your score.
   - Your final score is `12 - 1 = 11`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `m == points.length`
 - `n == points[r].length`
 - `1 <= m, n <= 1e5`
 - `1 <= m * n <= 1e5`
 - `0 <= points[r][c] <= 1e5`

---
### Hints:
 - Try using dynamic programming.
 - `dp[i][j]` is the maximum number of points you can have if `points[i][j]` is the most recent cell you picked.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Use DP to track the best results for the current row.
 - We only need to keep track of the current and previous rows.
 - To account for better answers from the left, we can keep track of the best score going left to right.
 - Do the same with another pass from right to left.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n * m)`
 - Space: `O(m)`

```js
var maxPoints = function(points) {
    let n = points.length, m = points[0].length,
        dp1 = new Array(m).fill(0), dp2, {max} = Math
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp2 = dp1, dp1 = new Array(m)
        for (let j = 0, best = 0; j < m; j++)
            dp1[j] = points[i][j] + (best = max(--best, dp2[j]))
        for (let j = m - 1, best = 0; ~j; j--)
            dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], points[i][j] + (best = max(--best, dp2[j])))
    }
    return max(...dp1)
};
```

### C++:
 - Time: `O(n * m)`
 - Space: `O(m)`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size(), m = points[0].size();
        vector<long long> dp1(m), dp2(m);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            swap(dp1, dp2);
            for (long long j = 0, best = 0; j < m; j++)
                dp1[j] = points[i][j] + (best = max(--best, dp2[j]));
            for (long long j = m - 1, best = 0; ~j; j--)
                dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], points[i][j] + (best = max(--best, dp2[j])));
        }
        return *max_element(dp1.begin(), dp1.end());
    }
};
```
