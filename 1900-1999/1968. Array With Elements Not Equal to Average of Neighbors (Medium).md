# [1968. Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-with-elements-not-equal-to-average-of-neighbors/)

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of **distinct** integers. You want to rearrange the elements in the array such that every element in the rearranged array is **not** equal to the **average** of its neighbors.

More formally, the rearranged array should have the property such that for every `i` in the range `1 <= i < nums.length - 1`, `(nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2` is **not** equal to `nums[i]`.

Return _**any** rearrangement of `nums` that meets the requirements_.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`
 - **Output**: `[1,2,4,5,3]`
 - **Explanation**:
   - When `i=1`, `nums[i] = 2`, and the average of its neighbors is `(1+4) / 2 = 2.5`.
   - When `i=2`, `nums[i] = 4`, and the average of its neighbors is `(2+5) / 2 = 3.5`.
   - When `i=3`, `nums[i] = 5`, and the average of its neighbors is `(4+3) / 2 = 3.5`.

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `nums = [6,2,0,9,7]`
 - **Output**: `[9,7,6,2,0]`
 - **Explanation**:
   - When `i=1`, `nums[i] = 7`, and the average of its neighbors is `(9+6) / 2 = 7.5`.
   - When `i=2`, `nums[i] = 6`, and the average of its neighbors is `(7+2) / 2 = 4.5`.
   - When `i=3`, `nums[i] = 2`, and the average of its neighbors is `(6+0) / 2 = 3`.

---
### Constraints:
 - `3 <= nums.length <= 1e5`
 - `0 <= nums[i] <= 1e5`

---
### Hints:
 - A number can be the average of its neighbors if one neighbor is smaller than the number and the other is greater than the number.
 - We can put numbers smaller than the median on odd indices and the rest on even indices.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - For three numbers to trigger this, they have to be ascending or descending together.
 - We can perform a wiggle sort to avoid the possibility.
 - We can use a modified quickselect algorithm to find the median and convert to wiggle order in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var rearrangeArray = nums => quickWiggle(nums)

// Converts standard index to wiggle index
const toWiggle = (i, n) => (2 * (n - i) - 1) % (n | 1)

// Modified custom quickselect algorithm
const quickWiggle = (arr) => {
    let n = arr.length, left = 0, right = n - 1, k = n + 1 >> 1
    while (true) {
        let a = left, b = left, c = right, 
            pivot = arr[findPivot(arr, left, right)]
        while (b <= c) {
            let result = arr[toWiggle(b, n)] - pivot           // converted
            if (result < 0)
                swap(arr, toWiggle(a++, n), toWiggle(b++, n))  // to
            else if (result > 0)                               
                swap(arr, toWiggle(b, n), toWiggle(c--, n))    // wiggle
            else
                b++
        }
        if (k <= a)
            right = a
        else if (k > b)
            left = b
        else
            return arr
    }
};
    
// Median of 3
const findPivot = (arr, left, right) => {
    let n = arr.length, mid = toWiggle(left + right >> 1, n)   // converted
    left = toWiggle(left, n), right = toWiggle(right, n)       // to wiggle
    if (arr[left] - arr[right] > 0)
        swap(arr, left, right)
    if (arr[left] - arr[mid] > 0)
        swap(arr, left, mid)
    if (arr[mid] - arr[right] > 0)
        swap(arr, mid, right)
    return mid
}

const swap = (arr, a, b) => {
    let temp = arr[a]
    arr[a] = arr[b], arr[b] = temp
}
```
