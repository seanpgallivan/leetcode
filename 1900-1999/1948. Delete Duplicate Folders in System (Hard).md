# [1948. Delete Duplicate Folders in System (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-folders-in-system/)

Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array `paths`, where `paths[i]` is an array representing an absolute path to the `i`th folder in the file system.
 - For example, `["one", "two", "three"]` represents the path `"/one/two/three"`.

Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are **identical** if they contain the **same non-empty** set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders **do not** need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are **identical**, then **mark** the folders as well as all their subfolders.
 - For example, folders `"/a"` and `"/b"` in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should **all** be marked:
   - `/a`
   - `/a/x`
   - `/a/x/y`
   - `/a/z`
   - `/b`
   - `/b/x`
   - `/b/x/y`
   - `/b/z`
 - However, if the file structure also included the path `"/b/w"`, then the folders `"/a"` and `"/b"` would not be identical. Note that `"/a/x"` and `"/b/x"` would still be considered identical even with the added folder.

Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will **delete** all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.

Return _the 2D array ans containing the paths of the **remaining** folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in **any** order_.

### Example 1:
![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/19/lc-dupfolder1.jpg)
 - **Input**: `paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]`
 - **Output**: `[["d"],["d","a"]]`
 - **Explanation**: The file structure is as shown.
   - Folders `"/a"` and `"/c"` (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named `"b"`.

### Example 2:
![diagram 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/19/lc-dupfolder2.jpg)
 - **Input**: `paths = [["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]`
 - **Output**: `[["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]`
 - **Explanation**: The file structure is as shown. 
   - Folders `"/a/b/x"` and `"/w"` (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named `"y"`.
   - Note that folders `"/a"` and `"/c"` are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.

### Example 3:
![diagram 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/19/lc-dupfolder3.jpg)
 - **Input**: `paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]`
 - **Output**: `[["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]`
 - **Explanation**: All folders are unique in the file system.
   - Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 1e4`
 - `1 <= paths[i].length <= 500`
 - `1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10`
 - `1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 1e5`
 - `path[i][j]` consists of lowercase English letters.
 - No two paths lead to the same folder.
 - For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.

---
### Hints:
 - Can we use a trie to build the folder structure?
 - Can we utilize hashing to hash the folder structures?

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Map folder names to numbers (`fmap`) for faster processing / less space (optional)
 - Build `trie` of paths
 - Run a DFS helper (`hash`) to hash each folder's contents
 - Map the contents hash values to numbers (`cmap`) for faster processing / less space (optional)
 - Store the hash number in the folder in the trie (`curr.content`)
 - Keep counts of folders with same contents (`contents`)
 - Delete any path which runs through a folder with same contents as another (`contents[curr.content] > 1`)

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(m.sort)` where `m` is the total count of characters in folder names
 - Space: `O(m.sort)`

```js
var deleteDuplicateFolder = function(paths) {
    let n = paths.length, fmap = new Map(), xpaths = []
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let path = paths[i], xpath = xpaths[i] = []
        for (let j = 0; j < path.length; j++) {
            if (!fmap.has(path[j]))
                fmap.set(path[j], fmap.size)
            xpath.push(fmap.get(path[j]))
        }
    }
    let trie = {}, cmap = new Map(), contents = []
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let xpath = xpaths[i], curr = trie
        for (let j = 0; j < xpath.length; j++)
            curr = curr[xpath[j]] ??= {}
    }
    const hash = (curr=trie) => {
        if (!Object.keys(curr).length)
            return -1
        let res = []
        for (let key of Object.keys(curr))
            res.push([key, hash(curr[key])])
        res = res.sort().join()
        curr.content = cmap.get(res) ?? cmap.set(res, cmap.size).get(res)
        contents[curr.content] = ~~contents[curr.content] + 1
        return curr.content
    }
    hash()
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let xpath = xpaths[i], curr = trie
        for (let j = 0; j < xpath.length; j++) 
            if (contents[(curr = curr[xpath[j]]).content] > 1)
                paths[i] = null, j = xpath.length
    }
    return paths.filter(Boolean)
};
```
