# [2053. Kth Distinct String in an Array (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-distinct-string-in-an-array/)

A **distinct string** is a string that is present only **once** in an array.

Given an array of strings `arr`, and an integer `k`, return _the `k`'th **distinct string** present in `arr`_. If there are **fewer** than `k` distinct strings, return _an **empty string** `""`_.

Note that the strings are considered in the **order in which they appear** in the array.

---
### Example 1:
 - **Input**: `arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2`
 - **Output**: `"a"`
 - **Explanation**: The only distinct strings in `arr` are `"d"` and `"a"`.
   - `"d"` appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.
   - `"a"` appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.
   - Since `k == 2`, `"a"` is returned. 

### Example 2:
 - **Input**: `arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1`
 - **Output**: `"aaa"`
 - **Explanation**: All strings in `arr` are distinct, so the 1st string `"aaa"` is returned.

### Example 3:
 - **Input**: `arr = ["a","b","a"], k = 3`
 - **Output**: `""`
 - **Explanation**: The only distinct string is `"b"`. Since there are fewer than `3` distinct strings, we return an empty string "".

---
### Constraints:
 - `1 <= k <= arr.length <= 1000`
 - `1 <= arr[i].length <= 5`
 - `arr[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

---
### Hints
 - Try 'mapping' the strings to check if they are unique or not.

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - Build a frequency map of `arr`.
 - Find the `k`'th entry with a frequency of `1`.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(n)`

```js
var kthDistinct = function(arr, k) {
    let freq = new Map()
    for (let str of arr)
        freq.set(str, ~~freq.get(str) + 1)
    for (let [key,val] of freq)
        if (val === 1 && k-- === 1)
            return key
    return ""
};
```
