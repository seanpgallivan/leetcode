# [2017. Grid Game (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-game/)

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D array `grid` of size `2 x n`, where `grid[r][c]` represents the number of points at position `(r, c)` on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

Both robots initially start at `(0, 0)` and want to reach `(1, n-1)`. Each robot may only move to the **right** (`(r, c)` to `(r, c + 1)`) or **down** (`(r, c)` to `(r + 1, c)`).

At the start of the game, the **first** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells `(r, c)` traversed on the path, `grid[r][c]` is set to `0`. Then, the **second** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.

The **first** robot wants to **minimize** the number of points collected by the **second** robot. In contrast, the **second** robot wants to **maximize** the number of points it collects. If both robots play **optimally**, return _the **number of points** collected by the **second** robot_.

### Example 1:
![diagram 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/08/a1.png)
 - **Input**: `grid = [[2,5,4],[1,5,1]]`
 - **Output**: `4`
 - **Explanation**: The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
   - The cells visited by the first robot are set to `0`.
   - The second robot will collect `0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 4` points.

### Example 2:
![diagram 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/08/a2.png)
 - **Input**: `grid = [[3,3,1],[8,5,2]]`
 - **Output**: `4`
 - **Explanation**: The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
   - The cells visited by the first robot are set to `0`.
   - The second robot will collect `0 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 4` points.

### Example 3:
![diagram 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/08/a3.png)
 - **Input**: `grid = [[1,3,1,15],[1,3,3,1]]`
 - **Output**: `7`
 - **Explanation**: The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
   - The cells visited by the first robot are set to `0`.
   - The second robot will collect `0 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 7` points.

### Constraints:
 - `grid.length == 2`
 - `n == grid[r].length`
 - `1 <= n <= 5 * 1e4`
 - `1 <= grid[r][c] <= 1e5`

---
### Hints:
 - There are `n` choices for when the first robot moves to the second row.
 - Can we use prefix sums to help solve this problem?

---
## Solution:
### Notes:
 - There are only two options for the second player, down then all right, or all right then down.
 - Sum up the top route, then iterate through and add to the bottom route while subtracting from the top route.
 - Player one controls the split, player two controls the route, so take the min of the max.

### Javascript:
 - Time: `O(n)`
 - Space: `O(1)`

```js
var gridGame = function(grid) {
  let n = grid[0].length, a = 0, {min, max} = Math,
      ans = b = grid[0].reduce((a,c) => a + c, -grid[0][0])
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++)
      ans = min(ans, max(a += grid[1][i - 1], b -= grid[0][i]))
    return ans
};
```
